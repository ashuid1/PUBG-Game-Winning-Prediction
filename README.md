## Overview
This repository contains code for a machine learning project aimed at predicting the outcome of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) matches. PUBG is a popular battle royale game where up to 100 players fight to be the last one standing on an island.

## Project Structure
1. data: Contains datasets used for training and testing the predictive models.
2. notebooks: Jupyter notebooks containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
3. src: Source code for the machine learning models and utility functions.
4. README.md: Overview of the project, including its objectives, methodologies, and results.
   
## Methodologies
1. Data Collection: Gathered gameplay statistics and match outcomes from PUBG matches.
2. Preprocessing: Handled missing values, scaled features, and encoded categorical variables.
3. Feature Engineering: Derived new features to capture player behavior and game dynamics.
4. Model Selection: Explored various machine learning algorithms and evaluated their performance.
5. Evaluation Metrics: Used accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess model performance.


## Results
1. Achieved high accuracy in predicting PUBG match winners.
2. Identified significant gameplay metrics influencing match outcomes.
3. Provided insights for players and esports analysts to improve strategies.
